# Zero to Mastery – Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning

This repository documents my hands-on learning process and notes while following the **Zero to Mastery: Learn PyTorch for Deep Learning** course.

The goal of this project is not only to complete the course exercises, but also to deeply understand PyTorch fundamentals through implementation, experimentation, and reflection.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Build a solid understanding of PyTorch core concepts
- Implement models from scratch instead of relying on high-level abstractions
- Develop correct training and evaluation workflows
- Record learning notes, common pitfalls, and insights during practice

## 🧠 What I Have Learned So Far

- PyTorch tensor operations and broadcasting rules
- Reproducibility using random seeds
- Building models using `nn.Module`
- Manual training loops (forward, loss, backward, optimizer step)
- Model evaluation using `eval()` and `inference_mode()`
- Inspecting learned parameters and comparing them with ground truth
- Understanding overfitting and train/test loss behavior

---

## 📊 Experiments & Results

Some training results and visualizations are saved in:

assets/images/
```

These include:
- Training and test loss curves
- Linear regression fitting results
- Parameter convergence visualizations

## 📝Notes & Reflections
- This repository is intentionally notebook-based, focusing on clarity and learning rather than production code.
- Code is written step-by-step to reflect the learning process.
- Comments and markdown cells are used to explain why something works, not just how.

---

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Extend experiments to multi-layer neural networks
- Add classification examples
- Explore GPU acceleration and performance differences
- Refactor selected notebooks into clean Python scripts
